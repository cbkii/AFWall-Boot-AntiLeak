## 1. Boot stage design

### Stage A — `post-fs-data` (before framework)

Runs before any Android framework services start.

Actions:
- Load config.
- Install iptables hard block (OUTPUT, FORWARD, optionally INPUT) for both
  IPv4 and IPv6. Dual-layer blackout: installs OUTPUT block in both the raw
  table (pre-conntrack, primary) and the filter table (shadow/failsafe) for
  defence-in-depth. If the raw layer is disrupted externally, the filter layer
  continues blocking OUTPUT traffic until the raw layer is repaired.
- Quiesce any network interfaces already present in `/sys/class/net`.
- Persist blackout state: `${STATE_DIR}/blackout_active` and
  `${STATE_DIR}/radio_off_pending`.
- Write early-phase interface list to state.

Framework radio commands (Wi-Fi off, mobile data off) are **deferred** to
Stage B. They are not valid in `post-fs-data` because the Wi-Fi and telephony
services are not running yet.

### Stage B — `service.sh` late phase (framework available)

Runs in a background subshell once Magisk's service phase completes.

Actions:
- **Startup integrity check**: verify that the dual-layer OUTPUT blackout
  (raw + filter) installed in Stage A is still intact for each IP family.
  If `block_installed=1` (written by Stage A) but any layer is missing or
  degraded, immediately repair it by re-installing both layers.  If repair
  fails, the family is still treated as blocked (fail-closed) so that the
  full handoff wait proceeds.
- Merge early-phase interface list with service-phase quiesce list.
- Wait for Android framework services (retry up to 5 times with 3s delay).
- Disable Wi-Fi via `cmd wifi set-wifi-enabled disabled`; fallback to `svc wifi disable`.
  - Verify off-state using: `settings get global wifi_on`, `cmd wifi status`,
    and wlan interface operstate.
  - Reinforce by bringing `wlan*`/`swlan*` interfaces down.
- Disable mobile data via `cmd phone data disable`; fallback to `svc data disable`.
  - Verify off-state using: `settings get global mobile_data` and absence of
    default routes via `rmnet*`/`ccmni*`/`wwan*` interfaces.
  - Reinforce by bringing cellular data interfaces down.

Radio-off reassertion runs every `RADIO_REASSERT_INTERVAL` seconds (default 10s)
while waiting for AFWall+ readiness.

Blackout integrity reassertion runs every `BLACKOUT_REASSERT_INTERVAL` seconds
(default 5s, configurable) while the OUTPUT block is active and handoff is
incomplete.  For each family, the module checks that the chain exists, the
DROP rule is present, and the OUTPUT jump exists in both the raw and filter
tables.  If any layer is missing, it is immediately repaired.

### Stage C — AFWall+ takeover detection

The main poll loop waits for AFWall+ to take over each IP family.

Per-family handoff (v4 and v6 tracked independently):

**Preferred path** (AFWall+ process visible):
1. AFWall main chain present in filter table with OUTPUT hook.
2. Chain contains at least one rule (non-trivial).
3. AFWall process visible continuously for `LIVENESS_SECS` (default 6s).
4. Rule-graph signature stable throughout.
5. Final settle: `SETTLE_SECS` (default 5s) re-check.
6. Mark family as takeover confirmed.

**Fallback path** (no process visibility):
1. AFWall main chain present, non-trivial.
2. Signature stable for `FALLBACK_SECS` (default 12s).
3. Optional: secondary evidence (AFWall data files newer than state file).
4. Final settle: `SETTLE_SECS` re-check.
5. Mark family as takeover confirmed.

### Stage D — Transport readiness check

After the main AFWall chain is confirmed for at least one IP family, the
module checks transport-specific chain readiness:

**Wi-Fi transport** (if `WIFI_AFWALL_GATE=1`):
- Check for `afwall-wifi` chain in filter table (v4 and v6).
- If present: require non-trivial rules + signature stable for `SETTLE_SECS`.
- If not present after `30s` of main chain readiness: fall back to accepting
  main-chain readiness (AFWall not using transport-specific chains).
- When ready: call `lowlevel_restore_wifi_if_allowed`.

**Mobile data transport** (if `MOBILE_AFWALL_GATE=1`):
- Same as Wi-Fi but checks `afwall-3g` chain.
- When ready: call `lowlevel_restore_mobile_data_if_allowed`.

### Stage E — Block release and restore

The module-owned iptables blocks are removed **only when**:
- The corresponding IP family takeover is confirmed, AND
- ALL required transports (Wi-Fi and mobile) are confirmed ready.

This means: if Wi-Fi is not yet ready, the IPv4 iptables block is not
removed even if the IPv4 family takeover would otherwise be complete.

After all blocks are removed:
- Remaining lower-layer state is restored (interfaces brought up, bluetooth,
  tethering note).
- Blackout state files are cleared.
- AFWall+ is now the sole active protection.

## 2. Transport-aware handoff

### AFWall chain names

| Chain         | Meaning                           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| `afwall`      | Main chain — all traffic          |
| `afwall-wifi` | Wi-Fi specific rules              |
| `afwall-3g`   | Mobile data specific rules        |

AFWall+ creates `afwall-wifi` and `afwall-3g` when the user has configured
per-transport rules. If these chains are absent, the module falls back to
accepting main-chain readiness after a wait period.

### Transport readiness proof requirements

Wi-Fi is considered ready only when ALL of the following are true:
1. AFWall main chain is confirmed in filter OUTPUT.
2. `afwall-wifi` chain exists with at least one rule.
3. Rule count for `afwall-wifi` is stable over `SETTLE_SECS`.

Mobile data is considered ready only when ALL of the following are true:
1. AFWall main chain is confirmed in filter OUTPUT.
2. `afwall-3g` chain exists with at least one rule.
3. Rule count for `afwall-3g` is stable over `SETTLE_SECS`.

Presence of the AFWall process alone is NOT sufficient proof. Existence of
the main `afwall` chain alone is NOT sufficient proof.

---

## 3. Timeout and unlock semantics

### Unlock-gated timeout (default: enabled)

When `TIMEOUT_UNLOCK_GATED=1` (default):
- The `TIMEOUT_SECS` countdown does NOT begin at boot.
- The countdown begins only after the device is positively detected as unlocked.
- Unlock detection uses two independent probes (keyguard state + screen awake).
  If either probe fails or is ambiguous, the device is treated as still locked.
- Before unlock: the module polls every `UNLOCK_POLL_INTERVAL` seconds.

### Auto timeout unblocking (default: disabled)

`AUTO_TIMEOUT_UNBLOCK=0` (default) means the module NEVER automatically
unblocks connectivity on timeout, regardless of `TIMEOUT_POLICY`.

To enable timeout-based unblocking:
1. Set `AUTO_TIMEOUT_UNBLOCK=1`
2. Set `TIMEOUT_POLICY=unblock`
3. Accept that if AFWall+ is absent/broken, connectivity will be restored
   after `TIMEOUT_SECS` seconds following device unlock.

### Legacy `TIMEOUT_POLICY=unblock`

This option is retained for compatibility but is now subject to:
1. `AUTO_TIMEOUT_UNBLOCK=1` (required; default is 0)
2. Device must be unlocked (when `TIMEOUT_UNLOCK_GATED=1`)

Setting `TIMEOUT_POLICY=unblock` alone (without `AUTO_TIMEOUT_UNBLOCK=1`)
will log a warning and behave as `fail_closed`.

### Fail-closed behaviour

When `TIMEOUT_POLICY=fail_closed` (default) or when auto-unblocking is
disabled:
- On timeout: lower-layer state (Wi-Fi, mobile) is restored, but iptables
  blocks are retained.
- Use the Magisk action button to manually remove blocks.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Device stuck offline after boot

**Step 1 — Check the log:**
```sh
cat /data/adb/AFWall-Boot-AntiLeak/logs/boot.log | tail -50
```
Look for the last status message to understand what the module is waiting for.

**Step 2 — Run manual recovery:**
```sh
sh /data/adb/modules/AFWall-Boot-AntiLeak/action.sh
```
Or use the Magisk app → Modules → AFWall Boot AntiLeak → Action.

**Step 3 — Check AFWall+ configuration:**
- Ensure "Firewall enabled on boot" is checked in AFWall+.
- Ensure you have active rules applied at least once.
- Disable "Fix Startup Data Leak" in AFWall+.

**Step 4 — Check iptables blocks:**
```sh
iptables -t raw -S | grep MOD_PRE_AFW
iptables -t filter -S | grep MOD_PRE_AFW
ip6tables -t raw -S | grep MOD_PRE_AFW
ip6tables -t filter -S | grep MOD_PRE_AFW
```
The module installs a dual-layer blackout (raw + filter) for defence-in-depth.
You should see `MOD_PRE_AFW` chains in both `raw` and `filter` tables for each
family while the blackout is active.  If blocks are present, the module is
still waiting for AFWall+.

**Step 5 — Check AFWall+ chain:**
```sh
iptables -t filter -S afwall | head -5
iptables -t filter -S afwall-wifi | head -5
iptables -t filter -S afwall-3g | head -5
```
If `afwall` is missing, AFWall+ has not applied rules. Check AFWall+ settings.

### Wi-Fi not coming back after AFWall+ loads

1. Check `WIFI_AFWALL_GATE`: if `1`, the module needs `afwall-wifi` chain.
2. Check log for `wifi transport` messages.
3. If AFWall+ doesn't use `afwall-wifi`, set `WIFI_AFWALL_GATE=0` in config.

### Mobile data not coming back

Same as Wi-Fi but for `MOBILE_AFWALL_GATE` and `afwall-3g`.

### Timeout fires but device stays offline

This is expected with the default `AUTO_TIMEOUT_UNBLOCK=0`. To allow
auto-unblocking on timeout:
```sh
# In /data/adb/AFWall-Boot-AntiLeak/config.sh:
AUTO_TIMEOUT_UNBLOCK=1
TIMEOUT_POLICY=unblock
```

---

## 7. Migration from v2.2.2

### Breaking changes

| Setting              | v2.2.2 default | v2.2.22 default | Action needed                      |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| `TIMEOUT_POLICY`     | `unblock`      | `fail_closed`    | If you want auto-unblock on timeout, set `AUTO_TIMEOUT_UNBLOCK=1` |
| Auto timeout unblock | always on      | off by default   | Set `AUTO_TIMEOUT_UNBLOCK=1` to restore old behaviour |
| Transport gating     | not present    | enabled by default | AFWall+ needs `afwall-wifi`/`afwall-3g` chains, or set gates to 0 |

### Preserved behaviours

- All existing config keys are recognised.
- Upgrade preserves your existing `/data/adb/AFWall-Boot-AntiLeak/config.sh`.
- The iptables chain names are unchanged.
- Lower-layer suppression options are unchanged.
- Per-family (v4/v6) handoff logic is preserved and extended.

### Recommended migration path

1. Install v2.2.22 over v2.2.2.
2. Review the new defaults; test on reboot.
3. If device gets stuck: run `action.sh` for recovery.
4. If AFWall+ lacks transport chains: set `WIFI_AFWALL_GATE=0 MOBILE_AFWALL_GATE=0`.
5. If you want the old auto-unblock on timeout:
   ```
   AUTO_TIMEOUT_UNBLOCK=1
   TIMEOUT_POLICY=unblock
   ```

---

## 8. Installer input and keycheck

### Volume key input priority

1. **Raw getevent** — primary method on modern Pixels (Android 7+).
   Uses `/system/bin/getevent -lq` with a timeout probe.
   Exit code 0 or 124 (timeout-killed) both indicate getevent is available.
2. **keycheck binary** — fallback for unusual recovery environments.
   Architecture-appropriate binary from `bin/keycheck/`.
3. **Non-interactive** — if neither method works:
   a. Read `${MODULE_DATA}/installer.cfg` for pre-seeded values.
   b. Preserve existing `${MODULE_DATA}/config.sh` on upgrades.
   c. Use standard safe defaults (fresh install).

### keycheck binary details

Located at `bin/keycheck/keycheck-arm64` (arm64, for Pixel 9a and all modern
Android devices).

The binary opens all `/dev/input/event*` devices and waits 10 seconds for a
`EV_KEY` DOWN event. Returns 41 (VOL+) or 42 (VOL-). Statically linked,
no runtime dependencies.

Source: `tools/keycheck.c` in the repository.

### Pre-seeded installer config

Place a file at `/data/adb/AFWall-Boot-AntiLeak/installer.cfg` before flashing
to skip interactive selection. Example:

```sh
IC_PROFILE=standard
# or IC_PROFILE=strict / minimal / custom
# Individual overrides (optional):
AUTO_TIMEOUT_UNBLOCK=0
TIMEOUT_UNLOCK_GATED=1
WIFI_AFWALL_GATE=1
MOBILE_AFWALL_GATE=1
```
